Arabic Text Classification: Evaluating and Comparing Machine Learning Models

Description:
This project investigates Arabic text classification by evaluating and comparing the efficacy of various machine learning models in processing Arabic texts. The study systematically explores several models, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Linear SVC, applied to a corpus of Arabic texts.

Methodology:
Model Selection and Testing:
The study tested multiple machine learning models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Linear SVC.
These models were applied to a diverse dataset of Arabic texts to evaluate their performance in classification tasks.
Evaluation Process:

The models were assessed through rigorous experimentation, measuring their accuracy and effectiveness in categorizing Arabic texts.
Accuracy was the primary metric used to compare model performance.

Findings:
The results revealed significant variations in model performance.
Logistic Regression and Linear SVC emerged as the top-performing models, each achieving an impressive accuracy of 98%.
These models demonstrated robustness and high effectiveness in classifying Arabic texts.

Implications:
The findings emphasize the importance of selecting the appropriate model for Arabic text classification.
The study highlights models that excel in this domain, providing valuable insights for enhancing natural language processing (NLP) applications tailored to the Arabic language.

Conclusion:
The project underscores the critical role of model selection in Arabic text classification, showcasing Logistic Regression and Linear SVC as particularly effective. These results pave the way for improved NLP applications and algorithms optimized for Arabic text analysis.
